  "body": "### PayWithText\r\nPayWithText is a simple way to make payments to others using only SMS developed by Ian Mobbs and Jacob Vanderlinden for HackTX 2016. By combining our passion for development and humanitarianism, we decided to do our best to create something that can truly change the world. PayWithText doesn't require any internet - only a cell signal. PayWithText was designed with those who can't afford internet-enabled phones in mind. A simple-to-use text-based interface facilitates trade for anyone with an account. \r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nSimply text 512.666.3017 to get started!\r\n\r\n### Real world application\r\nThis application is a proof of concept. Every user is given a mock account using CapitalOne's Reimagine Banking API, \"Nessie\", and allocated a random amount of money between $1 and $10,000. It then allows you to pay, request, and receive money from anyone with a cell phone number. By eliminating the need to carry around physical currency, we can help decrease robbery in places where digital currency isn't the norm, but carrying a cell phone is.\r\n\r\n### Technology\r\nPayWithText was built using Flask, a set of Python web frameworks. We store our information using MongoDB, host our application on AWS, and communicate with users using Twilio.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@IanMobbs and @JacobVanderlinden - Authors",
